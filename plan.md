# Advanced Analytics Dashboard with Authentication - Project Plan

## Current Goal
Transform the basic dashboard into a professional, data-expert-level analytical platform with advanced visualizations, user authentication, intelligent AI chatbot, and comprehensive data exploration tools.

## Phase 1: Authentication System & User Management âœ…
- [x] Install reflex-local-auth for authentication
- [x] Create login page with email/password fields and modern design
- [x] Build registration page with form validation
- [x] Implement protected routes and authentication middleware
- [x] Add user profile management (avatar, name, email, role)
- [x] Create logout functionality in header
- [x] Add "My Account" dropdown menu in header with profile/settings/logout options
- [x] Store user preferences (theme, dashboard layout)

## Phase 2: Advanced Data Visualizations & Visual Encoding Optimization
- [ ] Replace basic charts with advanced visualizations:
  - Multi-line comparison chart (Sales vs Profit trend with dual Y-axis)
  - Stacked area chart for category contribution over time
  - Scatter plot for quantity vs profit analysis with bubble sizing
  - Heatmap for regional + category performance matrix
  - Composed chart combining bar + line for order volume and average order value
- [ ] Implement interactive filtering system (date range picker, category filter, region selector)
- [ ] Add drill-down capabilities (click chart to filter other visualizations)
- [ ] Create KPI cards with sparklines showing micro-trends
- [ ] Implement data table with sorting, pagination, and export to CSV
- [ ] Add comparison mode (YoY, MoM, custom period comparisons)
- [ ] Build advanced color encoding based on data ranges (gradient scales for performance)

## Phase 3: Intelligent AI Chatbot Upgrade
- [ ] Install Groq API client (pip install groq)
- [ ] Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern with dataset context
- [ ] Add conversational memory and context awareness
- [ ] Create dynamic chart generation from natural language queries
- [ ] Implement data export from chat (download chart as image, export data as CSV)
- [ ] Add follow-up question suggestions based on conversation
- [ ] Implement streaming responses for better UX
- [ ] Add voice input option for queries
- [ ] Create chat history persistence per user
- [ ] Implement advanced analytics queries:
  - Predictive insights ("forecast next quarter sales")
  - Anomaly detection ("show unusual sales patterns")
  - Correlation analysis ("how does discount affect profit?")
  - Cohort analysis ("compare customer segments")

## Phase 4: Dashboard Enhancements & Additional Features
- [ ] Create multiple dashboard views (Executive Summary, Sales Analysis, Product Performance, Customer Insights)
- [ ] Add customizable dashboard layouts (drag-and-drop widgets)
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications for key metrics changes
- [ ] Build export/reporting functionality (PDF reports, scheduled emails)
- [ ] Add collaborative features (annotations, shared insights)
- [ ] Create admin panel for user management and system settings
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Create mobile-optimized responsive views
- [ ] Add data refresh indicator and manual refresh button

## Notes
- Phase 1 complete - authentication working with reflex-local-auth
- Groq API provides fast, free LLM inference (llama-3.3-70b-versatile model)
- Advanced visualizations should follow data visualization best practices:
  - Avoid chart junk, maximize data-ink ratio
  - Use appropriate chart types for data relationships
  - Implement colorblind-safe palettes
  - Add clear axis labels and legends
  - Show data uncertainty where applicable
- Chatbot should understand complex analytical queries and provide actionable insights
- All features should maintain Material Design 3 consistency
- Performance optimization: lazy loading, virtualization for large datasets
